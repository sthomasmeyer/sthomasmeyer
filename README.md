### M78: Reflecting Blue in a Sea of Red

![M78: Reflecting Blue in a Sea of Red](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2601/M78Red_McCauley_1080.jpg)

In the vast Orion Molecular Cloud complex, several bright blue nebulas are particularly apparent.  Pictured here in the center are two of the most prominent reflection nebulas - dust clouds lit by the reflecting light of bright embedded stars.  The more famous nebula is M78, in the image center, cataloged over 200 years ago.  To its upper left is the lesser known NGC 2071.  Astronomers continue to study these reflection nebulas to better understand how interior stars form.  The overall red glow is from diffuse hydrogen gas that covers much of the Orion complex that spans much of the constellation of Orion. Nearby in the greater complex, which lies about 1,500 light years away, are the Orion Nebula, the Horsehead Nebula, and Barnard's Loop -- partially seen here as the white band on the upper left.

## Words of the Day

### Dictionary.com

**tutoyer** _verb_ • /[too-twah-yey]/

to address someone familiarly

To tutoyer someone is to speak to them with easy familiarity, like switching from "sir" to "bro." The word comes from French, where it marks a precise grammatical shift to informal pronouns. Whether you're getting closer or letting your guard down, tutoyer is all about speaking freely.

> _After becoming friends with my neighbor, we began to tutoyer, dropping the formal titles completely._


### Britannica

**tradition** _noun_

A long-established custom or belief passed on from generation to generation, often within a particular group, family, or society.

> _The annual town fair is a cherished tradition that brings the community together every summer._
>
> _Many families uphold the tradition of a large holiday meal with extended relatives._
>
> _Breaking with tradition, the young artist decided to explore abstract forms rather than classical portraiture._
>

_Similar: custom, practice, heritage_  •  _Opposite: innovation, novelty, change_

> _"Tradition is a matter of much wider significance. It cannot be inherited, and if you want it you must obtain it by great labour. It involves, in the first place, the historical sense, which we may call nearly indispensable to anyone who would continue to be a poet beyond his twenty-fifth year."_

> — **T.S. Eliot**, Tradition and the Individual Talent (1919)


### Merriam-Webster

**bombast** _noun_ • /BAHM-bast/

Bombast is a formal word that refers to speech or writing that is meant to sound important or impressive but that is not sincere or meaningful.

> _You need less bombast and more substance in this speech._
>

> “This is bombast that has not been thought through from a policy perspective. I know that many in the space community find this to be exciting and want to believe the hype behind such an announcement. Mars is exciting. However ... I think we have to ask ourselves whether getting to Mars is worth the moral costs in addition to the economic costs and potential risks to human lives.” — P. J. Blount, quoted in Newsweek, 28 Jan. 2025

_Bombast settled softly into English in the mid-late 16th century as a textile term used to refer to cotton or other soft fibrous material used as padding or stuffing (its ultimate source is likely the Middle Persian noun pambak, meaning “cotton”), but within a decade it had extended from literal stuffing to figurative stuffing, referring to speech or writing that is padded with pretentious verbiage. The adjective bombastic, which followed bombast a century later, has been a favorite choice to describe blowhards, boasters, and cockalorums ever since._
