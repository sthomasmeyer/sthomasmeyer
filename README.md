### Shadow of a Martian Robot

What if you saw your shadow on Mars and it wasn't human?  Then you might be the Opportunity rover exploring Mars.  Opportunity explored the Red Planet from 2004 to 2018, finding evidence of ancient water, and sending breathtaking images across the inner Solar System.  Pictured here in 2004, Opportunity looks opposite the Sun into Endurance Crater and sees its own shadow.  Two wheels are visible on the lower left and right, while the floor and walls of the unusual crater are visible in the background.  Caught in a dust storm in 2018, Opportunity stopped responding, and NASA stopped trying to contact it in 2019 and declared the ground-breaking mission, originally planned for only 92 days, complete.

**yaw** _verb_ • /[yaw]/

to deviate from a straight course, as a ship

To yaw is to drift off course, especially when forward motion stays steady but direction does not. The word is most at home in nautical and aviation contexts, where even small deviations matter. When progress continues but alignment slips, yaw captures that sideways pull.

> _A sudden crosswind caused the small sailboat to yaw significantly off its intended path._

### Merriam-Webster

**foray** _noun_ • /FOR-ay/

A foray is an initial and often hesitant attempt to do something in a new or different field or area of activity, as in “the novelist’s foray into nonfiction.” In martial contexts, foray means “a sudden or irregular invasion or attack for war or spoils.”

> _The professional wrestler’s surprise foray into ballet was at first met with skepticism, but he eventually proved himself a dancer of grace and poise._
>

> “Bryan Escareño’s foray into fashion was the result of happenstance. In 2018, the designer, who was born and raised in Venice, California, bought a green vintage Singer sewing machine at a garage sale determined to learn to make the perfect pair of denim pants. … He began honing his sewing skills, eventually crafting cut-and-sew flannel shirts that caught the eye of his colleagues at LA’s Wasteland, a high-end resale boutique.” — Celia San Miguel, USA Today, 3 Dec. 2025

_For centuries, foray referred only to a sudden or irregular invasion or attack, but in the late 19th century it began to venture into gentler semantic territory. While the newer sense of foray still involves a trek into a foreign territory, the travel is figurative: when you make this kind of foray, you dabble in an area, occupation, or pastime that’s new to you. Take the particularly apt example (stay tuned) of mushroom hunting. The likely ancestor of foray is an Anglo-French word referring to the violent sort who do invasion forays, but that word could also refer to a forager—that is, one who wanders in search of food. (Forage has the same etymological source.) Interestingly, foray has seen a resurgence of use connected to its foraging roots, as evidenced by the growing popularity of mycophile-led mushroom “forays” that have been lately popping up like toadstools._
