### Miranda Revisited

What is Miranda really like?  Visually, old images from NASA's Voyager 2 have been recently combined and remastered to result in the featured image of Uranus's 500-kilometer-wide moon. In the late 1980s, Voyager 2 flew by Uranus, coming close to the cratered, fractured, and unusually grooved moon -- named after a character from Shakespeare’s The Tempest.  Scientifically, planetary scientists are using old data and clear images to theorize anew about what shaped Miranda's severe surface features.  A leading hypothesis is that Miranda, beneath its icy surface, may have once hosted an expansive liquid water ocean which may be slowly freezing.  Thanks to the legacy of Voyager 2, Miranda has joined the ranks of Europa, Titan, and other icy moons in the search for water, and, possibly, microbial life, in our Solar System.

## Words of the Day

### Dictionary.com

**vilipend** _verb_ • /[vil-uh-pend]/

to regard or treat as of little value or account

If you vilipend something, you're writing it off as not very important or valuable. The word comes from Latin roots meaning "to consider cheap," which gives it a quietly dismissive tone. Think of vilipend as a useful word for brushing something off as insignificant.

> _Don't vilipend your colleague's innovative idea just because you prefer traditional methods._


### Britannica

**inconsolable** _adjective_

Extremely sad and unable to be comforted.

>
> _The child's inconsolable crying filled the quiet house, echoing his profound grief._
>
> _Even his closest friends found it difficult to offer solace to the inconsolable widower._

### Merriam-Webster

**fortuitous** _adjective_ • /for-TOO-uh-tus/

Fortuitous is a formal word that usually describes something that comes or happens by a lucky chance. It can also mean “happening by chance” and “fortunate, lucky.”

> _The fact that we were both there was a fortuitous coincidence._
>
> _You could not have arrived at a more fortuitous time._
>

> “The timing of the hit’s resurgence proved fortuitous: She had nearly wrapped the recording for 2025 full-length Pressure ... and the scorching hot single provided a push in the lead-up.” — Mackenzie Cummings-Grady, Billboard, 11 Nov. 2025

_Before its meaning expanded, fortuitous meant one thing only: “happening by chance.” This was no accident; its Latin forebear, fortuitus, shares the same ancient root as fors, the Latin word for “chance.” But the fact that fortuitous sounds like a blend of fortunate and felicitous (“happily suited to an occasion”) likely led to a second meaning of “fortunate, lucky,” with the seeds of the newer sense perhaps planted by writers applying overtones of good fortune to something that is a random occurrence. The “lucky” use has been disparaged by critics, but it is now well established. Irregardless (cough), employing this sense in sterner company may be considered chancy._
