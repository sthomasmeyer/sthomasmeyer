### Orion's Treasures over Snowy Mountains

Rising over a frozen valley in the Tatra Mountains, the familiar stars and nebulas of Orion dominate this wide-field nightscape.  The featured deep photo was taken in southern Poland's highest mountain range last month, where dark skies and alpine terrain combined to reveal both Earth's rugged beauty and the structure of our galaxy.  Above the snowy mountains, Orion's bright belt stars anchor a region of glowing interstellar clouds.  The Great Orion Nebula, a vast stellar nursery visible even to the unaided eye, shines near the center of the scene.  Surrounding it is the enormous arc of Barnard's Loop, a faint shell of ionized hydrogen gas spanning much of the constellation.  To the left, the round Rosette Nebula glows softly, while the grayish Witch Head Nebula hovers to the right, illuminated by nearby starlight.  Near the top, the orange supergiant Betelgeuse marks the hunter's shoulder.

## Words of the Day

### Dictionary.com

**plage** _noun_ • /[plahzh]/

a beach at a seashore resort

A plage is more than just a beach — it's the kind with striped umbrellas, crystal blue water, and even a bit of glamour. The word was borrowed from French, and it still carries a breezy, European flair. If you're dreaming of your next coastal escape, plage brings the vacation vibes.

> _We spent the entire afternoon relaxing on the soft sands of the exclusive Sicilian plage._


### Britannica

**trivial** _adjective_

Of little importance or value; insignificant.

> _He often worried about trivial matters, ignoring the larger issues at hand._
>
> _The argument started over a truly trivial misunderstanding._

### Merriam-Webster

**fiduciary** _adjective_ • /fuh-DOO-shee-air-ee/

Fiduciary is a formal word describing something relating to or involving trust, such as the trust between a customer and a professional.

> _The bank's fiduciary obligations are clearly stated in the contract._
>

> "Banks and brokerage firms hold a fiduciary responsibility to protect their customers, including from scams." — Carter Pape, American Banker, 11 Aug. 2025

_Fiduciary relationships are often of the financial variety, but the word fiduciary does not, in and of itself, suggest pecuniary ("money-related") matters. Rather, fiduciary applies to any situation in which one person justifiably places confidence and trust in someone else, and seeks that person's help or advice in some matter. The attorney-client relationship is a fiduciary one, for example, because the client trusts the attorney to act in the best interest of the client at all times. Fiduciary can also be used as a noun referring to the person who acts in a fiduciary capacity, and fiduciarily or fiducially can be called upon if you are in need of an adverb. The words are all faithful to their origin: Latin fīdere, which means "to trust."_
