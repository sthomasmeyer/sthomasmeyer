ght billion people are about to disappear in this snapshot from space taken on 2022 November 21. On the sixth day of the Artemis I mission, their home world is setting behind the Moon's bright edge as viewed by an external camera on the outbound Orion spacecraft. Orion was headed for a powered flyby that took it to within 130 kilometers of the lunar surface. Velocity gained in the flyby maneuver was used to reach a distant retrograde orbit around the Moon. That orbit is considered distant because it's another 92,000 kilometers beyond the Moon, and retrograde because the spacecraft orbited in the opposite direction of the Moon's orbit around planet Earth. Swinging around the Moon, Orion reached a maximum distance (just over 400,000 kilometers) from Earth on 2022 November 28, exceeding a record set by Apollo 13 for most distant spacecraft designed for human space exploration. The Artemis II mission, carrying 4 astronauts around the moon and back again, is due to launch as early as February 6.

## Words of the Day

### Dictionary.com

**inure** _verb_ • /[in-yoor]/

to accustom to hardship, difficulty, or pain

To inure is to become gradually accustomed to difficulty, especially through repeated exposure. Whether it's cold weather, tough criticism, or early-morning alarms, being inured doesn't mean you like it — it just means you've gotten used to it.

> _Years of early-morning shifts helped inure her to the discomfort of waking up before dawn._


### Britannica

**languid** _adjective_

Lacking in vigor or spirit; listless or sluggish.

> _The hot, humid afternoon made everyone feel languid, preferring to rest indoors._
> _Her languid movements suggested a profound weariness rather than relaxation._
> _A languid melody drifted from the open window, perfectly suiting the lazy Sunday._

_Similar: listless, sluggish, lethargic_  •  _Opposite: energetic, vigorous, active_

> _"Her voice was a low, thrilling murmur, a languid, passionate voice, as if she had just awakened from a dream."_
>
> — **F. Scott Fitzgerald**, The Great Gatsby (1925)


### Merriam-Webster

**garner** _verb_ • /GAHR-ner/

Garner means "to acquire by effort; earn" or "to accumulate or collect."

> _The new research findings have garnered the attention of medical experts._
> _The group has garnered support from community organizations._

> "The novel was already a favourite among literary critics but it's sure to garner wider, more mainstream appeal following the Booker Prize win." — Daisy Lester, The Independent (United Kingdom), 11 Nov. 2025

_What do you call a building in which grain is stored? These days, English speakers are most likely to call it a granary, but there was a time when garner was also a good candidate. That noun made its way into the language in the 12th century (ultimately from Latin granum, "grain"); the verb garner followed three centuries later with a closely related meaning: "to gather into a granary." Today the verb has largely abandoned its agrarian roots—it usually means "to earn" or "to accumulate." Meanwhile the noun garner is rare in contemporary use. It's found mostly in older literary contexts, such as these lines from Sir Walter Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor: "Or, from the garner-door, on ether borne, / The chaff flies devious from the winnow'd corn."_
