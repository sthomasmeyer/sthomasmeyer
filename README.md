### LDN 1622: Dark Nebula in Orion

![LDN 1622: Dark Nebula in Orion](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2601/ldn1622fellows1024.jpg)

The silhouette of an intriguing dark nebula inhabits this cosmic scene. Lynds' Dark Nebula (LDN) 1622 appears against a faint background of glowing hydrogen gas only visible in long telescopic exposures of the region. In contrast, a brighter reflection nebula, vdB 62, is more easily seen just above the dusty dark nebula. LDN 1622 lies near the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy, close on the sky to Barnard's Loop, a large cloud surrounding the rich complex of emission nebulae found in the Belt and Sword of Orion. With swept-back outlines, the obscuring dust of LDN 1622 is thought to lie at a similar distance, perhaps 1,500 light-years away. At that distance, this 3 degree wide field of view would span about 100 light-years. Young stars do lie hidden within the dark expanse and have been revealed in Spitzer Space telescope infrared images. Still, the foreboding visual appearance of LDN 1622 inspires its popular name, the Boogeyman Nebula.

## Words of the Day

### Dictionary.com

**scofflaw** _noun_ • /[skawf-law]/

a person who flouts the law, especially one who fails to pay fines owed

A scofflaw is someone who openly disregards rules or regulations. The word was coined during Prohibition as part of a contest to name those who flouted alcohol laws, but the catchy word  outgrew that context before long. Whether it's unpaid parking tickets or shooting off fireworks weeks after New Year's, a scofflaw doesn't bother to play by the book.

> _The scofflaw always ignored his parking tickets, proving his disregard for city regulations._


### Britannica

**barricade** _verb_ • //ˌbærɪˈkeɪd//

To block or obstruct with a barrier, especially to prevent passage or entry.

> _The protestors barricaded the street with overturned bins and old furniture._
> _Fearing the approaching storm, the villagers began to barricade their windows with wooden planks._
> _The police quickly moved to barricade all escape routes from the building._

_Similar: block, obstruct, fortify_  •  _Opposite: open, unblock, clear_

> _"They barricaded the doors and windows with furniture, and waited."_
>
> — **H.G. Wells**, The War of the Worlds (1898)


### Merriam-Webster

**disheveled** _adjective_ • /dih-SHEV-uld/

A disheveled person or thing is not neat or tidy.

> _His wrinkled suit gave him a disheveled appearance._

> “My mother is waking up. ... She dresses quickly. Her oblong, Scots-Irish face may be too idiosyncratic for the screen anyway, the hollow cheekbones and sharp eyes, the straw-blond hair worn in a low-slung and slightly disheveled beehive.” — Matthew Specktor, The Golden Hour: A Story of Family and Power in Hollywood, 2025

_These days, the adjective disheveled is used to describe almost anything or anyone marked by disorder or disarray. Rumpled clothes, for example, often contribute to a disheveled appearance, as in Colson Whitehead’s novel Crook Manifesto, when the comedian Roscoe Pope walks onstage “disheveled, in wrinkled green corduroy pants.” Apartments, desks, bedsheets, you name it—all can be disheveled when not at their neatest and tidiest. Hair, however, is the most common noun to which disheveled is applied (along with hairdo terms like bun and beard), a fact that makes etymological sense. Disheveled comes from the Middle English adjective discheveled, meaning “bareheaded” or “with disordered hair.” That word is a partial translation of the Anglo-French word deschevelé, a combination of the prefix des- (“dis-“) and chevoil, meaning “hair.”_
