### Sharpless 249 and the Jellyfish Nebula

![Sharpless 249 and the Jellyfish Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2602/JellyfishBeecroft_final1_1024.jpg)

Normally faint and elusive, the Jellyfish Nebula is caught in this alluring telescopic field of view. Floating in the interstellar sea, the nebula is anchored right and left by two bright stars, Mu and Eta Geminorum, at the foot of the celestial twins. The Jellyfish Nebula itself is right of center, seen as a brighter arcing ridge of emission with dangling tentacles. In fact, this cosmic jellyfish is part of bubble-shaped supernova remnant IC 443, the expanding debris cloud from a massive star that exploded. Light from the explosion first reached planet Earth over 30,000 years ago. Like its cousin in astrophysical waters the Crab Nebula supernova remnant, the Jellyfish Nebula is known to harbor a neutron star, the ultradense remnant of the collapsed stellar core. An emission nebula cataloged as Sharpless 249 fills the field at the upper left. The Jellyfish Nebula is about 5,000 light-years away. At that distance, this image would be about 300 light-years across.

## Words of the Day

### Dictionary.com

**ascribe** _verb_ • /[uh-skrahyb]/

to attribute

To ascribe is to assign a cause, quality, or origin to something. The word tends to show up when we're discussing why things happen or where ideas come from, especially when the connection isn't obvious. Keep ascribe handy for nuanced explanations.

> _We must not ascribe every success solely to luck, but acknowledge hard work._


### Merriam-Webster

**nettle** _verb_ • /NET-ul/

To nettle someone is to make them angry or annoyed.

> _Though he tried to maintain a friendly tone, the town official was clearly nettled by the reporter's suggestion that the town was at fault._
>

> "I can't help but be reminded of an idiom that irked me no end during times of familial stress ... : 'Use it or lose it.' The message being that if a skill or resource is not regularly utilised, over time, we will lose it. As nettled as I was by it, I now feel obliged to acknowledge the obvious truth behind the catchphrase." — Gwen Loughman, The Journal (Ireland), 21 Aug. 2025

_If you've ever brushed against nettles, you know those plants have sharp bristles that can leave you smarting and itching. The painful and irritating rash that nettles cause can last for days, but at least it is a rash with a linguistic silver lining. The discomfort caused by nettles can serve to remind one that the verb nettle is a synonym of irritate. Nettle originated as a plant name that we can trace to the Old English word netel. Eventually, people likened the persistent stinging itch caused by the plant to the nagging aggravation of being annoyed, and nettle joined the likes of vex, peeve, and irk in describing such little miseries._
