A mere 56 million light-years distant toward the southern constellation Fornax, NGC 1365 is an enormous barred spiral galaxy about 200,000 light-years in diameter. That's twice the size of our own barred spiral Milky Way. This sharp image from the James Webb Space Telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) reveals stunning details of this magnificent spiral in infrared light. Webb's field of view stretches about 60,000 light-years across NGC 1365, exploring the galaxy's core and bright newborn star clusters. The intricate network of dusty filaments and bubbles is created by young stars along spiral arms winding from the galaxy's central bar. Astronomers suspect the gravitational field of NGC 1365's bar plays a crucial role in the galaxy's evolution, funneling gas and dust into a star-forming maelstrom and ultimately feeding material into the active galaxy's central, supermassive black hole.

## Words of the Day

### Dictionary.com

**anatine** _adjective_ • /[an-uh-tahyn]/

resembling a duck

Anatine describes anything that resembles a duck in appearance, behavior, or any other way you can imagine. It's a technical term, but there's a touch of whimsy in using it to label something ducklike. Whether it's a duck-shaped cloud or a waddle in someone's walk, anatine is the perfect word when "duckish" just won't do.

> _The yellow boat had an oddly anatine quality as it floated on the lake._

### Merriam-Webster

**schmooze** _verb_ • /SHMOOZ/

To schmooze is to warmly chat with someone often in order to gain favor, business, or connections.

> _The event provides an opportunity for local business owners to network and schmooze._

> "After wrapping up her speech filled with anecdotes and policy promises, the candidate schmoozed with the crowd, seemingly determined to shake every hand before her staff ushered her back to the bus." — Mike Kropf, The News Virginian (Waynesboro, Virginia), 4 Sept. 2025

_Schmooze (also spelled shmooze) schlepped into English from the Yiddish schmues, meaning "talk," which itself is from the Hebrew shěmu’ōth, meaning "news" or "rumor." Although originally used to indicate simply talking in an informal and warm manner, the word now commonly suggests conversation for the purpose of gaining favor, business, or connections. Schmooze is one of a number of English schm- words originating from Yiddish; other classics include schmaltz (referring to rendered animal fat or excessively sentimental music or art), schmuck (a slang word for "jerk"), schmutz ("a filthy or soiling substance"), and schmear ("a layer of cream cheese")._
