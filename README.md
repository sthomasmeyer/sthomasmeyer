## NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day

### Apollo 14: A View from Antares

![Apollo 14: A View from Antares](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2601/a14pan9335-43emj_900.jpg)

Apollo 14's Lunar Module Antares landed on the Moon on February 5, 1971. Toward the end of the stay astronaut Ed Mitchell snapped a series of photos of the lunar surface while looking out a window, assembled into this detailed mosaic by Apollo Lunar Surface Journal editor Eric Jones. The view looks across the Fra Mauro highlands to the northwest of the landing site after the Apollo 14 astronauts had completed their second and final walk on the Moon. Prominent in the foreground is their Modular Equipment Transporter, a two-wheeled, rickshaw-like device used to carry tools and samples. Near the horizon at top center is a 1.5 meter wide boulder dubbed Turtle rock. In the shallow crater below Turtle rock is the long white handle of a sampling instrument, thrown there javelin-style by Mitchell. Mitchell's fellow moonwalker and first American in space, Alan Shepard, also used a makeshift six iron to hit two golf balls. One of Shepard's golf balls is just visible as a white spot below Mitchell's javelin.

### Dictionary.com

**hypethral** _adjective_ • /[hi-pee-thruhl]/

(of a classical building) wholly or partly open to the sky

Hypethral describes buildings that are open to the sky — often temples or courtyards with no roof overhead. The word comes from ancient Greek roots meaning "under the ether," evoking open air and natural light. In hypethral design, the sky becomes the finishing touch.

> _The ruins included a beautiful hypethral temple, allowing a view of the sky above._


### Britannica

**migrate** _verb_ • //maɪˈɡreɪt//

To move from one country or place to live or work in another.

> _Many birds migrate south for the winter, seeking warmer climates and abundant food._
> _Economic hardship often compels families to migrate to different regions in search of better opportunities._

### Merriam-Webster

**notorious** _adjective_ • /noh-TOR-ee-us/

Notorious describes people and things that are well-known or famous, especially for something bad or unfavorable.

> _Their city is notorious for its extremely hot and humid summers._

> “Given Long Island’s cul-de-sac geography and notorious traffic, proposed bridges and tunnels to Connecticut are bound to get attention on the Island.” — Peter Gill, Newsday, 8 Dec. 2025

_For those who don’t give a fig about a bad reputation, being notorious for unpopular behavior is no biggie. (Being notorious for topping the Billboard charts? Now that’s a Biggie.) Although notorious (which comes from Latin noscere, “to come to know”) can be a synonym of famous, it’s more often a synonym of infamous, having long ago developed the additional implication of someone or something disreputable. The Book of Common Prayer of 1549 includes one of the first known uses of the unfavorable meaning in print, referring to “notorious synners.” You know what they say: more notorious synners, more problems._
