### Tails of Comet Wierzchoś

Some comets are regular guests of our solar neighborhood; others come by only once, never to return.  We won’t have another chance to see Comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchoś), which is currently making its way through the inner Solar System.  The hyperbolic orbit of this comet indicates that it will likely become an interstellar traveler.  Comet Wierzchoś is today near its closest approach to the Earth, passing roughly the same distance from the Earth as is the Sun.  The featured 30-minute exposure was taken last week in Chile and shows a 5-degree long ion tail as well as three shorter dust tails.  The green hue of the coma comes from the breakdown of dicarbon molecules by sunlight, but that process does not last long enough to also tinge the tails.  On the far right lies a spiral galaxy far in the distance: NGC 300.

## Words of the Day

### Dictionary.com

**lunation** _noun_ • /[loo-ney-shuhn]/

the period of time from one new moon to the next

A lunation is the time it takes for the moon to complete a full cycle of phases. From new moon to full moon and back again, a lunation is about 29.5 days. Whether you're tracking tides or traditions, a lunation helps you appreciate the moon's celestial rhythm.

> _The ritual is tied to a specific lunation, not a fixed calendar date._


### Britannica

**roadblock** _noun_

Something that stops progress; an obstacle or impediment.

> _Lack of funding proved to be a major roadblock for the ambitious research project._
>
> _Negotiators faced a significant roadblock when discussing the final terms of the treaty._
>

### Merriam-Webster

**abdicate** _verb_ • /AB-dih-kayt/

Abdicate usually means “to renounce a position of power, such as a throne, high office, dignity, or function.” It can also mean “to fail to do what is required by (a duty or responsibility).”

> _I know many challenges lie ahead, but I take this role on willingly, and will not abdicate my responsibility._
>

> “The story revolves around a plan by dark forces to kidnap the royal heirs and force the prince to abdicate his throne to an evil wizard.” — Screen Daily, 5 Jan. 2026

_Give it up for abdicate, a word powerful enough to undo a coronation. If you need a term to describe formally throwing in the towel, this one should prove—perhaps ironically—a royal success. Coming from the Latin verb abdicāre, “to resign, renounce, withdraw,” (which traces back to the verb dīcere, meaning “to speak, state”), abdicate is used primarily for those who give up sovereign power or who evade a very serious responsibility. English has dīcere to thank for a variety of other words, among them dictate, contradict, prediction, and the crown jewel of them all: dictionary._
