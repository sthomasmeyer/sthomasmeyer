### Description

What are all those streaks in the sky? A galaxy, many satellite trails, and a few meteors.  First, far in the distance, the majestic band of our Milky Way Galaxy runs down the left. Mirroring it on the right are several parallel trails of Earth-orbiting Starlink satellites. Many fainter satellite trails also crisscross the image. The two short and bright streaks are meteors â€” likely members of the annual Eta Aquariids meteor shower.  The planet Venus shines on the lower right.  Venus and the satellites shine by reflected sunlight. The featured picture is a composite of exposures all taken in a few hours on May 4 over the Limay River in Argentina.
