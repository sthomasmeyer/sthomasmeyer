### The Egg Nebula from the Hubble Telescope

ver wonder what it would look like to crack open the Sun?  The Egg Nebula, a dying Sun-like star, can unscramble this question.  Pictured is a combination of several visible and infrared images of the nebula (also known as RAFGL 2688 or CRL 2688) taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.  The star has shed its outer layers, and a bright, hot core (or yolk) now illuminates the milky egg white shells of gas and dust surrounding the center.  The central lobes and rings are structures of gas and dust recently ejected into space, with the dust being dense enough to block our view of the stellar core.  Light beams emanate from that blocked core, escaping through holes carved in the older ejected material by newer, faster jets expelled from the star’s poles.  Astronomers are still trying to figure out what causes the disks, lobes, and jets during this short (only a few thousand years!) phase of the star’s evolution, making this an egg-cellent image to study!

## Words of the Day

### Dictionary.com

**mumpsimus** _noun_ • /[muhmp-suh-muhs]/

a person who insists on doing things in an incorrect way

A mumpsimus is someone who clings to a mistaken way of doing things, even after the error has been pointed out. This silly-sounding word comes from a story about a priest who kept saying the wrong word during Mass. When stubbornness stands in the way of change, you may be dealing with a true mumpsimus.

> _Even after being corrected, the mumpsimus continued to write "for all intensive purposes" instead of "for all intents and purposes."_


### Britannica

**exhaust** _verb_

To use up all of someone's mental or physical energy, causing them to become completely tired or worn out.

### Merriam-Webster

**onomatopoeia** _noun_ • /ah-nuh-mah-tuh-PEE-uh/

Onomatopoeia refers to the creation of words that imitate natural sounds. It can also refer to the words themselves, such as buzz and hiss.

> _The author’s clever use of onomatopoeia delights children especially._
>

> “As they began to slurp, columns of noodles steadily streamed upward into their open jaws. The jazz soundtrack of Hiromi’s Sonicwonder playing ‘Yes! Ramen!!’ was punctuated by a gurgling roar reminiscent of shop vacs inhaling shallow pools. ‘We call it ‘hitting the zu’s,’’ says Steigerwald, noting the reference to zuru zuru, the onomatopoeia for slurping ramen in Japanese comics.” — Craig LaBan, The Philadelphia Inquirer, 18 Jan. 2026

_English speakers have only used the word onomatopoeia since the 1500s, but people have been creating words that imitate the sounds heard around them for much longer; chatter, for example, dates to the 1200s. Some onomatopes (as onomatopoeic words are sometimes called) are obvious—fizz, jingle, toot, and pop do not surprise. But did you know that other onomatopes include bounce, tinker, and blimp? Boom! Now you do. In fact, the presence of so many imitative words in language spawned the linguistic bowwow theory, which hypothesizes that language originated in the imitating of natural sounds. While it’s highly unlikely that onomatopoeia is the sole impetus for human language, it certainly made a mark, which is nothing to sneeze at._
