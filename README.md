## NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day

### Spiral Galaxy NGC 1512: Wide Field

![Spiral Galaxy NGC 1512: Wide Field](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2602/NGC1512_stern_960.jpg)

Most galaxies don't have any rings -- why does this galaxy have three?  To begin, a ring that's near NGC 1512's center -- and so hard to see here -- is the nuclear ring which glows brightly with recently formed stars.  Next out is a ring of stars and dust appearing both red and blue, called, counter-intuitively, the inner ring.  This inner ring connects ends of a diffuse central bar of stars that runs horizontally across the galaxy.  Farthest out in this wide field image is a ragged structure that might be considered an outer ring. This outer ring appears spiral-like and is dotted with clusters of bright blue stars.  All these ring structures are thought to be affected by NGC 1512's own gravitational asymmetries in a drawn-out process called secular evolution.  The featured image was captured last month from a telescope at Deep Sky Chile in Chile.

## Words of the Day

### Dictionary.com

**ossify** _verb_ • /[os-uh-fahy]/

to become rigid in habits, attitudes, or opinions

Ossify originally described the process of something turning into bone, but it's also used to describe routines or views that get a bit stuck. From mornings that never change to ideas that refuse to budge, ossify captures the stubborn side of human nature.

> _The man's exercise routine had ossified: a run around the neighborhood each morning, same route, same pace, every day._


### Merriam-Webster

**diaphanous** _adjective_ • /dye-AF-uh-nus/

Diaphanous is a formal word used to describe fabric of a texture so fine that one can see through it. Diaphanous is also sometimes used figuratively to describe something characterized by extreme delicacy of form.

> _The bride looked radiant in her floor-length gown and diaphanous veil._
>

> "With a bright pattern set on flaming crimson and a diaphanous petticoat underneath, the dress fits her perfectly." — David Wingrave, Harpers Magazine, 24 Oct. 2025

_What do the words diaphanous, epiphany, fancy, phenomenon, sycophant, emphasis, and phase all have in common? The Greek word phaínein shows more clearly in some of these words than in others, but it underlies all of them. The groundwork for diaphanous was laid when phaínein (meaning "to bring to light, cause to appear") was combined with the prefix dia- (meaning "through"). From that pairing came the Greek diaphanḗs ("transparent"), parent of the Medieval Latin diaphanus, which is the direct ancestor of the English word._
