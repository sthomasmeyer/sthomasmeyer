## NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day

### NGC 7023: The Iris Nebula

These cosmic clouds have blossomed 1,300 light-years away in the fertile starfields of the constellation Cepheus. Called the Iris Nebula, NGC 7023 is not the only nebula to evoke the imagery of flowers. Still, this deep telescopic image shows off the Iris Nebula's range of colors and symmetries embedded in surrounding fields of interstellar dust. Within the Iris itself, dusty nebular material surrounds a hot, young star. The dominant color of the brighter reflection nebula is blue, characteristic of dust grains reflecting starlight. Central filaments of the reflection nebula glow with a faint reddish photoluminescence as some dust grains effectively convert the star's invisible ultraviolet radiation to visible red light. Infrared observations indicate that this nebula contains complex carbon molecules known as PAHs. The dusty blue petals of the Iris Nebula span about six light-years.

### Dictionary.com

**mondegreen** _noun_ • /[mon-di-green]/

a word or phrase from a mishearing of another word or phrase, especially in a song or poem

A mondegreen happens when a phrase or lyric is misheard, giving it a whole new (and often funny) meaning. Songs, poems, and familiar sayings are prime territory for these accidental twists. Mondegreens remind us that sometimes mistakes can be pretty entertaining.

> _Like many other fans, she thought the lyrics were "All the lonely Starbucks lovers" instead of "Got a long list of ex-lovers," but she later learned it was a mondegreen._

### Merriam-Webster

**vendetta** _noun_ • /ven-DET-uh/

Vendetta refers to an active and mutual hatred between two families or groups, also known as a blood feud. It can also refer to an often prolonged series of retaliatory, vengeful, or hostile acts, or to a commitment to carrying out such acts.

> _The student insisted that the principal had a personal vendetta against her._

> "Rita publicly refused a vendetta at his funeral. She wouldn't ask her sons to avenge him, even though that wasn't just normal for the time, it was expected." — Rita Halász, Deep Breath: A Novel (translated by Kris Herbert), 2025

_English speakers borrowed vendetta, spelling and all, from Italian in the 19th century; literally meaning "revenge," vendetta first referred specifically to Italian and especially Corsican family- or clan-based feuds. It later extended in meaning to cover the acts that tend to feature in such feuds, and later still expanded further to refer to a commitment to carrying out such acts. Vendetta ultimately traces to the Latin verb vindicta, meaning "revenge" or "vindication." That Latin word is also in the family tree of other English terms related to getting even, including avenge, revenge, vengeance, vindicate, and vindictive._
