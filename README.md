## NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day

### Jupiter from the Webb Space Telescope

This infrared view of Jupiter by Webb is illuminating. High-resolution infrared images of Jupiter from the  James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) reveal, for example, differences between high-floating bright clouds -- including the Great Red Spot -- and low-lying dark clouds. Also clearly visible in the featured Webb image are Jupiter's dust ring, bright auroras at the poles, and Jupiter's moons Amalthea and Adrastea. The footprint of large volcanic moon Io's magnetic funneling of charged particles onto Jupiter is also visible in the southern aurora. Some objects are so bright that light noticeably diffracts around Webb's optics creating streaks.  Webb, which orbits the Sun near the Earth, has a mirror over six meters across making it the largest astronomical telescope ever launched -- with over six times more light-collecting area than Hubble.

## Words of the Day

### Dictionary.com

**pedagogy** _noun_ • /[ped-uh-goh-jee]/

the art or science of teaching

Pedagogy refers to the methods and mindsets behind effective teaching — not just what's taught, but also how it's delivered. It's a word used in education circles, but it also applies to the everyday challenge of helping others learn and understand. Whether it's in a classroom or a conversation, strong pedagogy is what makes learning stick.

> _The teacher studied various methods of instruction to improve her classroom pedagogy._


### Britannica

**compass** _noun_

A device used for determining direction, typically containing a magnetized needle that aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field and points to magnetic north.

> _The lost hiker relied on his compass to find his way back to the trail._
> _Ancient mariners used a simple magnetic compass to navigate vast oceans._
> _Without a reliable compass, exploring uncharted territory would be far more perilous._

> _"I had taken the precaution to bring a compass and had them all by good luck upon me."_
>
> — **Robert Louis Stevenson**, Treasure Island (1883)


### Merriam-Webster

**elicit** _verb_ • /ih-LISS-it/

Elicit is a formal word meaning “to get (a response, information, etc.) from someone.”

> _The announcement of the final amount raised by the charity walk elicited cheers from the crowd._
> _The teacher’s question elicited no response._

> “By the end of the ceremony, the attendees knew where each soon-to-be graduate would be studying next. The students lined up and stormed the stage, screaming their names and their postsecondary destinations while hoisting flags from the institutions in the air. ... Each proud declaration elicited raucous clapping and hooting from the crowd.” — Elizabeth Hernandez, The Denver Post, 15 May 2025

_Say them fast—or even slow—in isolation, and no one will know which one you mean: elicit and illicit both rhyme with the likes of explicit and complicit. But beyond being auditorily indistinguishable, they are used very differently. Illicit is an adjective applied to no-nos. It’s used to describe things people aren’t supposed to do. Something illicit is not permitted especially because it is illegal. Elicit, on the other hand, is a verb most often used to talk about calling forth or drawing out a response or reaction from someone, as in “her onstage antics elicited roars of laughter from the audience.” The Latin ancestors of this pair are easy to confuse too. Elicit comes from elicitus, illicit from illicitus. But going back just a little further, we find that elicit traces back beyond elicitus to lacere, meaning “to allure,” while illicitus comes ultimately from licēre, meaning “to be permitted.”_
