## NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day

### A Year of Sunspots

![A Year of Sunspots](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2602/Sunspots2025_SdoSanli_960.jpg)

How many sunspots can you see?  The central image shows the many sunspots that occurred in 2025, month by month around the circle, and all together in the grand central image.  Each sunspot is magnetically cooled and so appears dark -- and can last from days to months. Although the featured images originated from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, sunspots can be easily seen with a small telescope or binoculars equipped with a solar filter. Very large sunspot groups like recent AR 4366 can even be seen with eclipse glasses. Sunspots are still counted by eye, but the total number is not considered exact because they frequently change and break up.  Last year, 2025, coincided with a solar maximum, the period of most intense magnetic activity during its 11-year solar cycle.  Our Sun remains unpredictable in many ways, including when it ejects solar flares that will impact the Earth, and how active the next solar cycle will be.

**faux pas** _noun_ • /[foh pah]/

A faux pas is a misstep that causes embarrassment in a social setting. The phrase comes from the French for "false step," a fitting image for errors that happen without bad intent. Fortunately, most faux pas fade from memory almost as quickly as they're made.

### Merriam-Webster

**tabula rasa** _noun_ • /TAB-yuh-luh-RAH-zuh/

In general use, tabula rasa refers to something existing in an original pristine state. In philosophy, tabula rasa refers to the mind in its hypothetical primary blank or empty state before receiving outside impressions.

> _The apartment was only just renovated, and everything is clean and white; it's a tabula rasa, ready for a new occupant._
>

> “Bella, née Victoria, is a living breathing tabula rasa unfettered by societal pressures, propriety, or niceties.” — Ryan Lattanzio, Indie Wire, 16 June 2025

_Philosophers have been arguing that babies are born with minds that are essentially blank slates since the days of Aristotle. (Later, some psychologists took up the position as well.) English speakers have called that initial state of mental emptiness tabula rasa (a term taken from a Latin phrase that translates as “smooth or erased tablet”) since the 16th century, but it wasn't until British philosopher John Locke championed the concept in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding in 1690 that the term gained widespread popularity in our language. In later years, a figurative sense of the term emerged, referring to something that exists in an original state and has yet to be altered by outside forces._
