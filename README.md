### Planet Parade over Sydney Opera House

![Planet Parade over Sydney Opera House](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2602/PlanetParadeSydney_Agrawal_960_ann.jpg)

Look up this week and see a whole bunch of planets.  Just after sunset, looking west (mostly), planets Mercury, Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter will all be visible to the unaided eye simultaneously.  If you have a telescope, planets Uranus and Neptune can also be seen.  In order up from the horizon, the lineup this week will be Venus (the brightest), Mercury, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, and Jupiter (second brightest).  It doesn't matter where on Earth you live because this early evening planet parade will be visible through clear skies all around the globe.  The planets will appear to be nearly in a line because they all orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane: the ecliptic.  The featured image shows a similar planet parade that occurred in 2022, captured over the Sydney Opera House in southern Australia.  Although visible all week, the planets will be most easily seen together this weekend.

## Words of the Day

### Dictionary.com

**odontoid** _adjective_ • /[oh-don-toid]/

of or resembling a tooth

Odontoid describes something that resembles a tooth in shape or function. The word is most often used in anatomy and science, where form is carefully observed and named. When a structure narrows to a pointed, toothlike profile, odontoid fits cleanly.

> _The unusual bony structure had an odontoid appearance that puzzled the biologists._


### Britannica

**investigate** _verb_ • //ɪnˈvɛstɪˌɡeɪt//

To carry out a systematic or formal inquiry to discover and examine the facts of an incident, allegation, or problem.

> _The police will thoroughly investigate the claims of fraud._
>
> _It is crucial to investigate all potential side effects of the new medication._
>
> _Before making a judgment, one must investigate the circumstances fully._
>

_Similar: examine, explore, probe_  •  _Opposite: ignore, overlook, disregard_

> _"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. My dear Watson, you must not only see, but you must also investigate."_
>
> — **Arthur Conan Doyle**, A Study in Scarlet (1887)


### Merriam-Webster

**umpteen** _adjective_ • /UMP-teen/

Umpteen is an informal adjective meaning "very many" or "indefinitely numerous."

> _The artist has painted the same subject umpteen times, yet each piece has its own unique quality._
>

> "The life of a showgirl often includes umpteen costume changes, elaborate props and copious amounts of hairspray." – The Economist, 4 Oct. 2025

_There may not be a gazillion ways in English to refer to a large, indefinite number, but there are definitely more than a soupçon. Many of these, such as zillion, bazillion, kazillion, jillion, and bajillion, start with -illion (as in million) and add a satisfying consonant or syllable in front for some extra oomph. The adjective umpteen does the same for -teen, with the oomph provided by the ump in umpty. Umpty, an adjective meaning "such and such" (as in "umpty percent" or "umpty-four") arose, like umpteen, in the latter half of the 1800s. We only occasionally use umpty these days, but you're bound to hear or read umpteen and umpteenth ("latest or last in an indefinitely numerous series") any number of times._
