### Phobos: Doomed Moon of Mars

![Phobos: Doomed Moon of Mars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2601/Phobos_MRO_960.jpg)

This moon is doomed. Mars, the red planet named for the Roman god of war, has two tiny moons, Phobos and Deimos, whose names are derived from the Greek for Fear and Panic. These Martian moons may well be captured asteroids originating in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter or perhaps from even more distant reaches of our Solar System. The larger moon, Phobos, is indeed seen to be a cratered, asteroid-like object in this stunning color image from the robotic Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which can image objects as small as 10 meters. But Phobos orbits so close to Mars - about 5,800 kilometers above the surface compared to 400,000 kilometers for our Moon - that gravitational tidal forces are dragging it down. In perhaps 50 million years, Phobos is expected to disintegrate into a ring of debris.

## Words of the Day

### Dictionary.com

**boustrophedon** _noun_ • /[boo-struh-feed-n]/

an ancient method of writing in which the lines run alternately from right to left and from left to right

Boustrophedon describes a style of ancient writing that moves in alternating directions, like an ox plowing a field. Instead of restarting on the same side, each line flips — right to left, then left to right. You don't see boustrophedon much today, but its zigzag pattern is hard to forget once you've pictured it.

> _The inscription was written in boustrophedon, changing direction with each new line of text._

### Merriam-Webster

**resplendent** _adjective_ • /rih-SPLEN-dunt/

Resplendent is a literary word used to describe someone or something as very bright and attractive.

> _She looked resplendent in her green evening gown._
>

> “Her box braids were tied in a top bun that poked out of her green and gold headscarf... . Pretty as the braids were, he quietly missed the natural hair they protected. When unbound, her hair was a resplendent halo of vitality. But he knew the halo required a complex, labor-intensive morning and night routine for which she had lost patience.” — Karim Dimechkie, The Uproar: A Novel, 2025

_Resplendent shares a root with splendid (meaning, among other things, “shining” or “brilliant”), splendent (“shining” or “glossy”), and splendor (“brightness” or “luster”). Each of these glowing terms gets its shine from the Latin verb splendēre (“to shine”). In the case of resplendent, the prefix re- added to splendēre formed the Latin resplendēre, meaning “to shine back.” Splendent, splendor, and resplendent were first used in English during the 15th century, but splendid didn’t light up our language until almost 200 years later; its earliest known use dates from the early 1600s._
