## NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day

### Io in True Color

![Io in True Color](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2601/iotruecolor_galileo_960.jpg)

The strangest moon in the Solar System is bright yellow.  The featured picture, an attempt to show how Io would appear in the true colors perceptible to the average human eye, was taken in 1999 July by the Galileo spacecraft that orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003.  Io's colors derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock.  The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes.  The intense tidal gravity of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons.  The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing  molten rock to explode through the surface.  Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out.  Some of Io's volcanic lava is so hot it glows in the dark.

## Words of the Day

### Dictionary.com

**krummholz** _noun_ • /[kroom-hohlts]/

a forest of stunted trees near the timber line on a mountain

Krummholz refers to the twisted, stunted trees found near a mountain's timber line, shaped by wind and cold. The word comes from German, literally translated as "crooked wood," and it captures both the harshness of alpine life and nature's resilience. In every gnarled branch, krummholz tells a story of survival.

> _We hiked through the dense, wind-battered krummholz near the mountain's treeline._


### Britannica

**taper** _verb_

To become gradually smaller toward one end.

> _The architect designed the tower to taper elegantly towards its apex._
> _As the river approached the sea, it began to taper into a narrow channel._
> _The candle's flame began to taper as the wax dwindled._

_Similar: narrow, diminish, lessen_  •  _Opposite: widen, broaden, expand_

> _"The trunks of the trees, which were mostly pines, began to taper, and the branches to spread out more horizontally."_
>
> — **Henry David Thoreau**, Walden; or, Life in the Woods (1854)


### Merriam-Webster

**quiddity** _noun_ • /KWID-uh-tee/

Quiddity refers to the essence of a thing—that is, whatever makes something the type of thing that it is. Quiddity can also refer to a small and usually trivial complaint or criticism, or to a quirk or eccentricity in someone's behavior.

> _The novelist’s genius was her unparalleled ability to capture the quiddity of the Maine seacoast in simple prose._
> _He portrayed the character's quirks and quiddities with tender playfulness._

> “When I was gathering my odes into a book—or rather, piling up my effusions in prose and verse and trying to work out which ones were odes and which weren’t—my friend Carlo gave me a magical concept. He called it ‘the odeness.’ It’s the essential quality, quiddity, … uniqueness of whatever you’re trying to write about. It’s what your ode is attempting to first identify and then celebrate. It’s the odeness of your ode.” — James Parker, The Atlantic, 30 Sept. 2025

_When it comes to synonyms of quiddity, the Q’s have it. Consider quintessence, a synonym of the “essence of a thing” meaning of quiddity, and quibble, a synonym of the “trifling point” use. And let’s not forget about quirk: like quiddity, quirk can refer to a person’s eccentricities. Of course, quiddity also comes from a “Q” word, the Latin pronoun quis, which is one of two Latin words for “who” (the other is qui). Quid, the neuter form of quis, led to the Medieval Latin quidditas, which means “essence,” a term that was essential to the development of the English word quiddity._
